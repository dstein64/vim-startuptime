1. Requirements                            |startuptime-requirements|
2. Installation                            |startuptime-installation|
3. Usage                                   |startuptime-usage|
4. Configuration                           |startuptime-configuration|

|vim-startuptime| is a plugin for viewing vim and nvim startup event timing
information. The plugin is customizable (see |startuptime-configuration|).

============================================================================
1. Requirements                            *startuptime-requirements*

* `vim>=8.0.1453` or `nvim>=0.2.2`
  - The plugin may work on earlier versions, but has not been tested.
  - The plugin depends on compile-time features for vim (not applicable for
    nvim).
    * |+startuptime| is required.
    * |+timers| is recommended, to capture all startup events.
    * |+terminal| is required.

============================================================================
2. Installation                            *startuptime-installation*

Use |packages| or one of the various package managers.

============================================================================
3. Usage                                   *startuptime-usage*

The *:StartupTime* command launches |vim-startuptime|.

Press <space> on events to get additional information. The key sequence for
additional information can be customized (see |startuptime-configuration|).
Times are in milliseconds.

Arguments ~
                                           *startuptime-arguments*
|:StartupTime| takes the following optional arguments.

* `--sort` and `--no-sort` specify whether events are sorted.
* `--sourced-events` and `--no-sourced-events` specify whether 'sourced
script' events are included.
* `--other-events` and `--no-other-events` specify whether 'other lines'
events are included.
* `--self` and `--no-self` specify whether to use 'self' timings for 'sourced
script' events (otherwise, 'self+sourced' timings are used).
* `--tries` specifies how many startup times are averaged.
* `--help` shows this help documentation.

4. Configuration                           *startuptime-configuration*

The following variables can be used to customize the behavior of
|vim-startuptime|. The |:StartupTime| optional arguments have higher precedence
than these options.

Variable
  Description                           Default

`g:startuptime_more_info_key_seq`         `<space>`
  Key sequence for getting more
  information
`g:startuptime_exe_path`                  `running vim` path
  Path to `vim` for startup timing
`g:startuptime_exe_args`                  `[]`

  Specifies whether events are sorted
`g:startuptime_tries`                     `1`
  Specifies how many startup times
  are averaged
`g:startuptime_sourced_events`            `1`
  Specifies whether 'sourced script'
  events are included
`g:startuptime_other_events`              `1`
  Specifies whether 'other lines'
  events are included
`g:startuptime_self`                      `0`
  Specify whether to use 'self'
  timings for 'sourced script' events
`g:startuptime_event_width`               `20`
  Event column width
`g:startuptime_time_width`                `6`
  Time column width
`g:startuptime_percent_width`             `7`
  Percent column width
`g:startuptime_plot_width`                `26`
  Plot column width

The variables can be customized in your |.vimrc|, as shown in the following
example.

`StartupTimeSourcingEvent` |Type|       Color for sourcing event names
`StartupTimeOtherEvent`    |Identifier| Color for other event names
`StartupTimeTime`          |Directory|  Color for the time column
`StartupTimePercent`       |Special|    Color for the percent column
