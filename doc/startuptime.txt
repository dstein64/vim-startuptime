|vim-startuptime| is a plugin for viewing vim and nvim startup event timing
information. The plugin is customizable (see |startuptime-configuration|).

Related Documentation ~

1. |--startuptime| `vim` command option
2. |+startuptime| `vim` compile-time feature

============================================================================
1. Requirements                            *startuptime-requirements*

* `vim>=8.0.1453` or `nvim>=0.2.2`
  - The plugin may work on earlier versions, but has not been tested.
  - The plugin depends on compile-time features for vim (not applicable for
    nvim).
    * |+startuptime| is required.
    * |+timers| is recommended, to capture all startup events.
    * |+terminal| is required.

============================================================================
2. Installation                            *startuptime-installation*

Use |packages| or one of the various package managers.

3. Usage                                   *startuptime-usage*

* The *:StartupTime* command launches |vim-startuptime|.
* Press <space> on events to get additional information.
* Press <cr> on sourcing events to load the corresponding file in a new split.
* The key sequences above can be customized (see |startuptime-configuration|).
* Times are in milliseconds.

Arguments ~
                                           *startuptime-arguments*
|:StartupTime| takes the following optional arguments.

* `--sort` and `--no-sort` specify whether events are sorted.
* `--sourcing-events` and `--no-sourcing-events` specify whether sourcing
  events are included.
* `--other-events` and `--no-other-events` specify whether other events
  are included.
* `--self` and `--no-self` specify whether to use 'self' timings for sourcing
  events (otherwise, 'self+sourced' timings are used).
* `--tries` specifies how many startup times are averaged.
* `--help` shows this help documentation.

4. Configuration                           *startuptime-configuration*

The following variables can be used to customize the behavior of
