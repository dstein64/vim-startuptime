|vim-startuptime| is a plugin for viewing vim and nvim startup event timing
information, obtained by running (n)vim with the |--startuptime| argument. The
plugin is customizable (see |startuptime-configuration|).

============================================================================
1. Requirements                            *startuptime-requirements*

* `vim>=8.0.1453` or `nvim>=0.3.1`
  - The plugin may work on earlier versions, but has not been tested.
  - The plugin depends on compile-time features for vim (not applicable for
    nvim).
    * |+startuptime| is required.
    * |+timers| is recommended, to capture all startup events.
    * |+terminal| is required.

============================================================================
2. Installation                            *startuptime-installation*

Use |packages| or one of the various package managers.

3. Usage                                   *startuptime-usage*

* The *:StartupTime* command launches |vim-startuptime|.
* Press `K` on events to get additional information.
* Press `gf` on sourcing events to load the corresponding file in a new split.
* The key sequences above can be customized (see |startuptime-configuration|).
* Times are in milliseconds.

Arguments ~
                                           *startuptime-arguments*
|:StartupTime| takes the following optional arguments.

* `--sort` and `--no-sort` specify whether events are sorted.
* `--sourcing-events` and `--no-sourcing-events` specify whether sourcing
  events are included.
* `--other-events` and `--no-other-events` specify whether other events
  are included.
* `--sourced` and `--no-sourced` specify whether to use 'self+sourced' timings
  for sourcing events (otherwise, 'self' timings are used).
* `--tries` specifies how many startup times are averaged.
* `--help` shows this help documentation.

4. Configuration                           *startuptime-configuration*

The following variables can be used to customize the behavior of
|vim-startuptime|. The optional |startuptime-arguments| have higher precedence
than these options.

 >
	" Link StartupTimeSourcingEvent highlight to Title highlight
	highlight link StartupTimeSourcingEvent Title

	" Specify custom highlighting for StartupTimeTime
	highlight StartupTimeTime
	       \ term=bold ctermfg=12 ctermbg=159 guifg=Blue guibg=LightCyan

Filetype Plugin ~
                                           *startuptime-ftplugin*
A `startuptime` filetype plugin (|ftplugin|) can be used to further customize
|vim-startuptime|.

5. Information                             *startuptime-information*

The `startup` time reported at the top of the output is the total time to start
the editor. This does not necessarily equal the sum of values in the time
column since events can overlap. The reported percents are taken relative to
the `startup` time, and thus don't necessarily sum to 100%.

The require(...) events added in Neovim PR #19267 are treated as if they are
sourcing events. The full path to the underlying file is not provided, but an
attempt to deduce this path is made when fulfilling a request to open the file
in a new split.
